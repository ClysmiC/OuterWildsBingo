                    <li>It may take multiple lives to complete all of the goals. Partially completed goals carry their progress over to your next life. For example, if your goal was to touch 3 different quantum shards and you only touched 2 before dying, you could complete the goal by touching 1 more (different!) shard in your next life.</li>
                    <li>Nothing that happens after setting foot on The Eye counts as progress towards any goals. This rule helps remove a lot of potential ambiguity about what does/doesn't count for certain goals.</li>
