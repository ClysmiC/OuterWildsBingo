				This is a randomly generated bingo card for <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html">Outer Wilds</a>. To complete the card, you must complete all 5 squares in a single row, column, or diagonal.

				<ul>
					<li>The card is generated using the seed in the URL. To send this card to a friend, simply copy/paste the URL. You can generate a new card with the buttons below.</li>
					<li>You can click on squares to turn them green or red. You can also click on a row/col/diag header to turn its squares blue. This can help you stay organized.</li>
					<li>Many squares have underlined text that can be hovered over for clarifications.</li>
                    <li>Many squares have built-in counters that you can use to help you remember your progress.</li>

			<div id="txtRules">

				The card generation algorithm and ruleset below are designed so that any card <i>should</i> be optimally completable with a single excellent run. That being said, it will likely
				often take you multiple loops if you die or cannot complete all your goals in time. If you have any questions or rule suggestions, please let me know @ClysmiC11.

				<ul>
					<li>If racing, generate the card when every is on the "wake up" screen. Start the timer as soon as the card is generated.</li>
					<li>Do not start on a new file. You don't need to get the launch codes and you are allowed to use your computer to track locations.</li>
					<li>You are allowed to manipulate time by pausing, resting, meditating, suiciding, changing in-game settings, etc.</li>
					<li>Time ends as soon as you have completed all 5 squares in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
					<li>No end-game events that happen after setting foot on The Eye count as progress towards any square (this eliminates a bunch of ambiguity).</li>
					<li>Partial progress towards completing a square <i>does</i> carry over between time loops. That said, if the square requires you to do something at X different locations, you cannot get credit for the same location twice.</li>
					<li>"Bodies" means any location that you can select on your computer's map: Sun Station, Ash Twin, Ember Twin, Timber Hearth, Attlerock, Brittle Hollow, Hollow's Lantern, Giant's Deep, Orbital Probe Cannon, Dark Bramble, White Hole Station, The Interloper, or Quantum Moon.</li>
					<li>"Natural bodies" means any "body" except for Sun Station and Orbital Probe Cannon.</li>
					<li>"Moons" means Attlerock, Hollow's Lantern, or Quantum Moon.</li>
					<li>"Planets" means Ash Twin, Ember Twin, Timber Hearth, Brittle Hollow, Giant's Deep, or Dark Bramble.</li>
					<li>Ash Twin and Ember Twin are considered separate planets/bodies. If a goal considers them to be the same entity it will refer to them as the Hourglass Twins.</li>
					<li>"Touch" means touch with your person or your ship.</li>
					<li>"X &lt;-&gt; any body" means traverse from X to any other body, or from any other body to X.</li>
					<li>Chunks of Brittle Hollow that have fallen through the black hole are <i>not</i> considered part of Brittle Hollow (nor White Hole Station, for that matter).</li>
					<li>The Probe Tracking module is <i>not</i> considered part of the Orbital Probe Cannon (it <i>is</i> considered part of Giant's Deep).</li>
					<li>Squares that specify getting a specific ending are completed once the game displays the text for that ending. See <a href="https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Endings">https://outerwilds.gamepedia.com/Endings</a>.</li>
					<li>"Watch the supernova with X" squares are completed once the supernova kills you. You must be within eyeshot and earshot to be "with" them.</li>
					<li>Translating audio logs also counts as translating. But audio logs/text from Hearthian's don't count because you didn't need to translate them!</li>
